<h1>Tryunfo</h1>

<p>
  Tryunfo was an application developed during the Trybe fullstack course. In this project was developed a game in the style of Super Trump! When using     this application a user should be able to: create a free-themed deck, add and remove a card from the deck, view all cards that have been added to the     deck and play with the created deck. Initially the project would be developed using class components in react. However, the application was refactored   using functional components and context API, making the code cleaner and more readable, in addition to avoiding prop drilling.
