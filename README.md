<h1>Tryunfo</h1>

<p>
    Tryunfo is a simplified version of Super Trump game. Initially the project was developed using class components and react. I refactored using 
    functional components and context API, making the code cleaner and more readable, in addition to avoiding prop drilling. The user is able to 
    create a free-themed deck,add and remove a card from the deck, view all cards that have been added to the deck and play with the created deck.

<p>
   The application was deployed with Vercel.
